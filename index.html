<p>Zones. We all live within them.</p>

<p>Housing zones, traffic zones (as in how fast one can drive), ethnic and social-economic zones, wealth and income zones – in life, there are zones for nearly everyone and every item relatable to our civilized lives.</p>

<p>Zones, for the most part, tell a person that they’re within a certain area, percentage, group, or anything else that seeks to be a placeholder for individuals who instead of being narrowed down, exist within a broad scope of a collection.</p>

<p>Substance abuse also has its specific type of zone. It’s the sort of place where, according to experts, “you may or may not be,” which in the world of alcohol, roughly translates into you may or may not be a drunk.</p>

<p>This is the alcoholic zone. It’s nothing mysterious or beyond explanation. Don’t expect the alcoholic zone to be met with as much head-scratching as The Twilight Zone.</p>

<p>The alcoholic zone is really quite easy to understand.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-the-alcoholic-zone" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-alcoholic-zone" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT IS THE ALCOHOLIC ZONE?</h3>

<p>Just like any other zone, the alcoholic zone is an area of generality. What an alcoholic zone can suggest is you might be well within the boundaries of what defines an alcoholic.</p>

<p>In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a government-appointed independent panel of experts released a report that considered not those who drank to the extent that their behavior could be classified as acute alcoholism.</p>

<p>Instead, the study took aim at those men and women who are neither abusers nor alcoholics but who nevertheless drink more than the limits recommended by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Those limits are as follows:
• For men, a maximum of 14 drinks per week and 4 drinks on any one day.
• For women, a maximum of 7 drinks per week and 3 drinks on any one day.
If your drinking meets or even exceeds the above limits, you still might not be an alcoholic. Sure, you drink past a recommended number of alcoholic beverages, but keep in mind that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issues these amounts as guidelines, not hardened borders between what is an alcohol abuser and what is not.</p>

<p>Remember, the alcoholic zone is only a general consensus. It by no means should be thought of as a defined area which, should you fall into the area, you’re immediately regarded as a drunk.</p>

<p>Knowing this, you should instead debunk yourself before debunking the alcoholic zone. Pose serious questions toward your drinking, and ask if yourself if you feel you should slow down your imbibing, or even stop it altogether.</p>

<p>It’s up to you and how seriously you take the alcoholic zone in connection with your own drinking.</p>
